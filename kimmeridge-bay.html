          <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Kimmeridge Bay</strong> is a stunning, sheltered cove on Dorset's 
        <strong>Jurassic Coast</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is famous for 
        its rocky ledges, excellent rock pooling, snorkelling, surfing, and fossil 
        hunting, making it one of the most distinctive coastal locations in the area.

            The Bay's sheltered position and rich marine life make it one of Dorset's hidden gems. The shale ledges and rock pools are perfect for snorkelling, fossil hunting, and simply enjoying the quiet - it rarely gets as crowded as bigger beaches on the Jurassic Coast.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Fascinating for fossil hunters and geologists alike, the bay's rocks hold ammonites, belemnites, and other ancient remains. It's also a top spot for surfing when conditions are right, thanks to the reef break.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Where is Kimmeridge Bay?</h2>

      <p class="fs-5">
        The bay lies on the <strong>Isle of Purbeck</strong> peninsula, approximately 
        <strong>7 miles east of <a href="index.html">Tyneham Village</a> and Worbarrow Bay</strong>. It sits just 
        south-west of the small village of <strong>Kimmeridge</strong>, with dramatic 
        cliffs and wide sea views.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        The main car park postcode is <strong>BH20 5PF</strong>. Enter this into your 
        sat nav to reach the toll booth and parking area overlooking the bay.

          <strong>From Wareham or Corfe Castle (north / east):</strong> Take the 
          <strong>A351</strong> south towards Corfe Castle, then follow signs for 
          <strong>Church Knowle / Kimmeridge</strong> (turn right after Corfe Castle). 
          Continue through Kimmeridge village and follow the road downhill to the toll 
          booth. Vehicle charges typically range from <strong>£5-£10</strong> in 2026 
          and include all-day parking. Cash and card are usually accepted; pedestrians 
          and cyclists are free.
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>From Swanage (east):</strong> Travel west on the

        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>From Tyneham or West Lulworth (west):</strong> There is no direct road 
          access due to the Lulworth military ranges. The best route is via

          <strong>20-30 minutes</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fs-5 mt-3">
        The private toll road is well maintained but narrow in places, so drive with 
        care. Parking is on grassy clifftop areas, with additional parking near the

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Rock pooling (especially at low tide), the

        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Facilities:</strong> Public toilets and the

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Nearby attractions:</strong> <strong>Clavell Tower</strong>, a striking

        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Dogs:</strong> Dogs are welcome year-round but should be kept on leads 
          near wildlife and other visitors.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Access note:</strong> The bay is calm and sheltered, making it popular 
          with families, but it is rocky rather than sandy. Sturdy footwear is 
          strongly recommended.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fs-5 mt-4">
        Quieter than busy hotspots like <strong><a href="lulworth-cove.html">Lulworth Cove</a></strong>, Kimmeridge Bay 
        is ideal for visitors looking for a peaceful and scenic day out on the 
        Jurassic Coast.

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  On your way down to Kimmeridge Bay, you'll pass through the charming little village of Kimmeridge itself. With only a couple of hundred residents, it's a peaceful, picturesque spot lined with traditional Purbeck stone cottages—many of them thatched—that give it a wonderfully timeless atmosphere.

<h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">A Village Rich in History</h3>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  Kimmeridge has roots stretching back over a thousand years, first appearing in the <a href="https://opendomesday.org/">Domesday Book</a> of 1086 as “Chinewerce”. Much of its historic character has survived, with many cottages dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. At the heart of the village stands the parish church of <strong>St Nicholas of Myra</strong>, which has Norman origins (though largely rebuilt in 1872). It's worth stepping inside for its quiet, atmospheric interior.
</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Must-See Attractions in the Village</h3>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  The standout attraction is <strong>The Etches Collection</strong>, a world-class museum of Jurassic marine fossils located right in the village centre. Collected over decades by local fossil hunter Dr Steve Etches MBE, the museum houses more than 2,800 exquisite specimens—all discovered in the Kimmeridge area—including the famous pliosaur skull featured in David Attenborough documentaries.
</p>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  Opposite the museum you'll find <strong>Clavell's Café & Restaurant</strong>, a popular stop for hearty meals, afternoon cream teas, or simply a coffee in the sunny courtyard—using plenty of local Dorset ingredients.
</p>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  Just a short walk or drive from the village is the iconic <strong>Clavell Tower</strong>, a 19th-century folly perched dramatically on the cliffs above the bay. Famously moved brick-by-brick in 2006 to save it from coastal erosion, it's now a unique holiday let managed by the Landmark Trust and offers breathtaking panoramic views across the Jurassic Coast.
</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Local Traditions & Community</h3>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
  Kimmeridge retains a strong sense of community and tradition. One of the highlights is the occasional <strong>Wassail</strong> celebration—a lively ancient custom to bless the apple orchards, complete with singing, dancing, and toasting for a bountiful harvest (reflecting the area's cider-making heritage).
