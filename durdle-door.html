          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Durdle Door is a 7.5-mile drive from Tyneham village. Alternatively, you can take the coastal walk - roughly a mile shorter - and enjoy one of Dorset's most spectacular stretches of coastline. Walking from <a href="">Tyneham</a> will take about 3 hours if you don't stop along the way.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5">What is Durdle Door?</h2>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Durdle Door is a natural limestone arch on Dorset's Jurassic Coast - one of the most photographed and recognisable landmarks in the UK. Carved over thousands of years by the sea, the arch is made of hard Portland limestone (the same stone used for St Paul's Cathedral), while the softer rocks around it have eroded away.

            Below the arch lies Durdle Door Beach (also called Durdle Door Cove) - a beautiful pebble beach with clear waters, perfect for swimming, sunbathing, or simply admiring the view. The dramatic setting makes it a favourite with photographers and day-trippers alike.

        <li class="list-group-item">
          Head south from the village along the signed path down the valley to 
          <strong>Worbarrow Bay</strong> (around 1 mile). This is an easy downhill 
          walk to the shingle beach — a great spot for a break, dip, or picnic.

          From the bay, climb steeply west up <strong>Worbarrow Tout</strong>, then

          <strong>1 mile</strong> and takes <strong>30-45 minutes</strong>, with

            There's no parking on the beach itself. Swimming is allowed but there are no lifeguards - take care with tides and currents.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The path from the car park to the beach is about half a mile: steep downhill followed by roughly 150 steps. It's a good workout coming back up, so wear sensible shoes and bring water.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            You'll find toilets and usually a refreshment kiosk at the car park. On the beach itself there are no facilities.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            It gets very busy in summer - on the busiest days police sometimes close access to the whole area (including Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door). Arriving early or visiting outside peak season is recommended.
