            Flower's Barrow, the dramatic hillfort overlooking Worbarrow Bay, is one of Dorset's most impressive ancient sites. From its Iron Age origins as a fortified settlement to its later use by the Romans, this windswept headland has watched over the Jurassic Coast for thousands of years.

          <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5">The Location of Flower's Barrow</h2>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Flower's Barrow sits at the western end of <a href="worbarrow-bay.html">Worbarrow Bay</a>, just a short walk from Tyneham village. The footpath southwest from the village takes you up onto the ridge - about 30-40 minutes - with stunning views over the bay and Chesil Beach in the distance.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">The Walk from Tyneham Village to Flower's Barrow</h3>
          <p class="fs-5">
        This popular circular walk (approximately <strong>4-5 miles / 6-8 km</strong>, 
        allowing <strong>2-3 hours</strong>) takes you from the abandoned village of 
        <strong>Tyneham</strong> up to the dramatic Iron Age hillfort at 
        <strong>Flower's Barrow</strong>. The route offers stunning views across the 
        <strong>Jurassic Coast</strong> and the Purbeck Hills.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5">
        The walk is of <strong>moderate difficulty</strong>, with a steady climb from the village, 
        mostly level ridge walking, and an optional steep descent if returning via 
        <strong>Worbarrow Bay</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="alert alert-warning mt-4" role="alert">
        <strong>Important access notice:</strong> This route crosses the 
        <strong>Lulworth Ranges</strong>, an active MOD military training area. 
        Walking is only permitted on official open days — typically most weekends, 
        school holidays, and daily during Christmas, Easter, and the summer period. 
        Always check current access dates for 2026 on

      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mt-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Start in <strong>Tyneham Village</strong> and take time to explore the ruins, 
          church, and former school, which contain informative displays about the 
          village's history.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Head north through the village, passing the church and school, and follow 
          the signed track uphill towards <strong>Whiteway Hill</strong>. This section 
          is a steady but manageable climb.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          At the top, go through the gate and turn left along the ridge path. This 
          section follows the <strong>Purbeck Hills ridgeway</strong> and offers easy, 
          mostly level walking.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Continue west along the ridge for around <strong>1-1.5 miles</strong> until 
          you reach <strong>Flower's Barrow</strong>. Walk through the hillfort ramparts 
          and enjoy panoramic views east towards Poole Harbour, west to Portland, 
          and south across the English Channel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Return Options</h3>

      <div class="mt-3">
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Option 1: Direct Ridge Return</h4>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Retrace your steps east along the same ridge path back to <a href="index.html">Tyneham</a>. This is 
          the shorter and easier option, ideal if time or weather is limited.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mt-3">
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Option 2: Via Worbarrow Bay <small class="text-muted">(Recommended)</small></h4>
        <p class="fs-5">
          From Flower's Barrow, follow the <strong>South West Coast Path</strong> west, 
          descending steeply to <strong><a href="worbarrow-bay.html">Worbarrow Bay</a></strong>. The shingle beach is an 
          excellent spot for a rest or picnic.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          From the bay, follow the level track inland along the valley, keeping close 
          to the stream. Turn left at <strong>Tyneham Farm</strong> to return to the 
          village and car park.
        </p>

      <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Tips for Visitors</h3>

      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mt-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Best time to go:</strong> Clear, dry days offer the best views. Avoid 
          wet or windy conditions, as paths and cliffs can become slippery.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>What to bring:</strong> Sturdy walking shoes, water, and snacks. There 
          are no facilities along the route beyond Tyneham village.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Dogs:</strong> Dogs are welcome but should be kept on a lead, 
          especially near livestock and cliff edges.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Some paths near the village and ridge are 
          suitable for wheelchairs or mobility scooters, but the steep coastal 
          sections are not accessible.

          <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Ancient Origins: A Fortified Past</h2>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Flower's Barrow began as an Iron Age hillfort around 2,500 years ago. Built on this high, naturally defensible headland, it featured multiple rings of earthen banks and ditches, with timber and stone walls on top.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The complex layout - with several concentric defences - suggests the fort was expanded over time. Inside, an Iron Age community would have lived, farmed the surrounding land, and traded with neighbouring tribes.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            When the Romans arrived in the 1st century AD, they recognised the strategic value of the site and built a fort within the existing hillfort. They modified the defences and added their own structures, including what may have been a bathhouse.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The Roman fort helped control coastal trade and the nearby harbour. A Roman road linked it to Dorchester (Durnovaria), the regional capital.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The Roman fort was abandoned sometime in the 4th century AD - possibly due to economic decline or shifting military priorities. After that, the site fell quiet, slowly overtaken by nature.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The site is vulnerable to coastal erosion, so visitors are asked to stick to marked paths and respect the fragile earthworks. Ongoing monitoring and conservation work help protect this special place for future generations.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Flower's Barrow is more than just an ancient monument - it's a window into thousands of years of human history on the Dorset coast. A visit here, combined with Tyneham village and Worbarrow Bay, makes for an unforgettable day out.
