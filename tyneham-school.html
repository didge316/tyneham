          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
            Tyneham Village School, built in 1856, was the heart of education for the local community. Children from the village itself and from surrounding farms walked – sometimes several miles – to attend classes here. On bad weather days or during outbreaks of illness, numbers could drop sharply, but the school remained a vital part of daily life.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Farming seasons also affected attendance. Many pupils had to stay home to help with harvesting, hedging, ditching, and other essential work on the land – a common reality in rural schools of the time.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fw-bolder mt-5 mb-4">A Single Classroom for All Ages</h2>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
            The school was a true one-room setup, with children aged 4 to 14 all taught together. The youngest sat on the stage behind a curtain, learning with simple tools like beads on strings and blunt crayons. It wasn’t unusual for even three-year-olds to tag along with older siblings.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Education in the 1920s</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
            Discipline was strict under head teacher Mrs Pritchard (1921–1928). There was no talking in class, and knuckles were rapped for poor handwriting posture. Children learned joined-up writing from the start, with careful attention to letter spacing. Every morning began with saluting the Union Flag – a routine common across British schools at the time.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Evening entertainments were a highlight – villagers brought their own chairs, children sat on the floor or bookcases, and the room was lit by paraffin lamps while bench desks were moved outside.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Though designed for up to 60 pupils, the school never reached full capacity. When the coastguard station at Worbarrow closed in 1912, nearly half the children left. Numbers continued to fall through the 1920s, and by 1932 only nine pupils remained. The school closed that year and became the village hall, with the remaining children bused to Corfe Castle.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
            Today, the school building has been beautifully restored and serves as a small museum. Step inside and you’re immediately transported back to a 1920s classroom – desks, blackboard, and all. It’s one of the most evocative spots in the village, giving a real sense of what rural education was like before the war.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The school stands as a quiet tribute to the generations of Tyneham children who learned here, and to the dedicated teachers who guided them through a simpler, harder, but often fondly remembered era.

                        Just saw a clip from “Mysteries of the Abandoned,, the town that disappeared,” found this site for more information. Thanks for satisfying my curiosity of this village. It reminds me of going to the Amish school room, that they have on display (along with children mannequins dressed in their Amish or Mennonite clothes), in Pennsylvania.

                        I was watching the abandoned engineering programme on Yesterday. I caught a brief glimpse of a name which I think was Margaret Whysall? but it was in a very fast scan past so not sure. As you can understand I would love to have this confirmed or otherwise.<br><br>
                        I did some of my training in Tyneham more years ago now than I care to remember. What I do recall though is tear gas is not nice.<br><br>
                        Thank you in anticipation<br>
