                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-4">Nestled amidst the picturesque landscapes of Dorset's Jurassic Coast, Tyneham Village is a poignant relic of a bygone era. Visiting Tyneham is like stepping back in time.. The charming stone cottages, school and church provide a haunting yet evocative glimpse into the lives of the villagers who were forced to abandon their homes during World War II.</p>

                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-4">Why Did Tyneham's Inhabitants Leave?</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The story behind the evacuation of Tyneham Village is a poignant chapter in British history. In 1943, during the height of World War II, the British military requisitioned the village and the surrounding area for training purposes.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">Due to its proximity to the Lulworth firing ranges, the government decided to claim Tyneham village and much of its surrounding land as a place to train the Allied forces.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">The villagers were told they must temporarily leave their homes for the greater good.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">This decision was made as part of the preparation for critical military operations, including the D-Day landings.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">The residents of Tyneham were faced with a difficult and heart-wrenching choice. The military needed their homes and lands to create a realistic training environment for troops preparing for the challenges of warfare.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">As a result, the villagers were given a mere 28 days' notice to evacuate their homes, leaving behind the lives they had built over generations.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">The promise was that they would be able to return once the war was over. However, the war extended beyond its initial projections, and the village and its surroundings became an essential training ground for various military exercises. As a consequence, the return of the villagers never materialized.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">In December 1943, the last church service was held in the village's <a href="tyneham-church.html">St. Mary's Church</a>, and the villagers left their homes, believing they would be back soon.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">They didn't know it at the time, but once the war was over, they would never be allowed to return to their homes. As they packed up their belongings and left, they pinned a note to the door of the village church which read:</p>
                            <figure class="mb-2 text-center"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="/assets/note-left-on-church-door.jpg" alt="Note left on Tyneham Church door"/></figure>
                            <p class="fs-6 mb-4 text-center">The Note Left on The Church Door</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5 pt-4">Did The Villagers Ever Return?</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Until now, despite a number of high-profile campaigns, the original residents have never been allowed to return to their homes.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The reality, however, was that Tyneham became trapped in time, frozen in its wartime state. The houses, school, church, and other buildings were preserved, but the villagers were never able to reclaim their community.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">Today, Tyneham Village stands as a living memorial to its former residents and a reminder of the sacrifices made during times of conflict.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">The decision to leave was borne out of the necessity of supporting the war effort, but it left behind a void that can still be felt among those who visit the village and learn about its history.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">Sadly, nearly early all the evacuees have now passed away. Their last thoughts and memories were captured on the Tyneham Remembered documentary. Because of this, it remains unlikely that the government will release the village.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">The village of Tyneham has remained as if frozen in time for the last 80 years.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">When Tyneham village is open, it's a lovely place to visit and provides a glimpse into the past of how life used to be in this quaint little village. Please check the <a href="opening_times.html">opening dates</a> before visiting.</p>

                                Tyneham House, unfortunately, no longer exists. It was the manor house of Tyneham Village but was requisitioned by the military during World War II and later demolished. The village's other buildings and ruins still offer insight into its history.

                        I recently saw an episode of country tracks which was aired on BBC 1 on 22/08/2010 which was episode 47. It was a piece about tyneham village and featured Doug Churchill talking about having to leave his old house during the war. When the piece started on the programme presented by Jodie Kidd there was a piece of very enchanting music that was so beautiful that I can't get it out of my head and I can't find any information of what the music was. Can anyone help me to try and track it down. Thanks

                                I have visited Tynehamm several times and never fail to be absolutely fascinated by it. I am hoping to visit again later this year.<br><br>
                                I would encourage anyone who has not been there to make a visit.

                        A wondrous site and a piece of history the majority of the world forgot. Walking around the remains of the village, we felt the sadness that still prevails and the isolation of the place prior to its forced eviction.

                        As a child I lived in Sandford near Wareham and there is a road called Tyneham cl where some of the people evacuated from Tyneham lived. I remember a man called John Gould who fought for the families of Tyneham and the return of their village which sadly has not happened. I love Tyneham it is my favourite place in my beloved Dorset. It is preserved trapped in time where life was lived at a slower pace and people were close knit. If you have not visited yet then you should you will be charmed by this sad but beautiful village.

                        Hi Tim, I've only just noticed your message. I researched the feature for Country Tracks and might be able to find out the piece of music for you. Drop me a line on <a href="mailto:anna.taylor@bbc.co.uk">anna.taylor@bbc.co.uk</a> and I'll see what I can do. Many thanks.

                        I visited there to find my surname on one of the houses. Would love to know if they were related to me. I found the village fascinating. But it was a wet and muddy day. So we are going back this year on a better day.

                        My mother now Nancy Banister (Coupe) was born in 1921. She remembers it fondly. Her father was rector at Tyneham. I know she would love to move back.

                        My Grandmother attended the school at Tyenham, her work is visible in one of the writing desks and her name is on the pegs as you enter the building.<br><br>
                        My family has a huge amount of history and were some of the residents that were displaced but returned.<br><br>
                        Sadly my Grandmother isn't alive any more but my cousins still live in the area near Grange Road and farm the area and maintain all of the arable land which is used by the military and the mining.<br><br>
                        The mining company have destroyed some of the farm houses on the land, where my grand parents and parents grew up and they wanted to evict my cousins - they were part of the BBC program COAST.<br><br>
                        If anyone is interested in our family history here then please get in touch.<br><br>
                        FYI my grand mother is Violet Burt and her desk is the one with the butter fly drawing.

                        I just finished the book, “The House at Tyneford” a novel based on the great estate at Tyneham set during WWII. Written by Natasha Solomon's, it was a great read!!

                        My mother Nancy Coupe was born at Tyneham rectory in 1921, her father was the rector.<br>
                        She remembers well many events that happened at Tyneham. She will be 95 on the 16th April 2016 and still going strong. We hope to visit Tyneham with mother this summer.

                        I love this little village. I walk this area quite often, and it still makes me angry, that the Army still need, the village for army maneuvers?

                        Visited Tyneham in late 1960s. Beautiful place. Have just read novel by Natasha Solomons - The Novel of the Viola which has brought it all back. Have watched the MOD saga over the years and am disgusted with their stance. Studying geology at the time, I visited Kimmeridge and the fossilised forest (with permit from MOD).<br><br>
                        Ever hopeful the MOD will relent. Plenty of empty bases in Scotland where locals would welcome income!<br>
                        Maybe Sturgeon could help?<br>
                        Good luck.<br>

                        Some of my relatives lived in the village and Great Uncle Bob is listed in the register in the church, Shepherd Welland. His wife Alice was employed at the Big House.<br><br>
                        At the evacuation he moved to a tiny cottage dug into the side of a hill very near the village of Corfe close to where his daughter lived and as far as I know descendants live to this day.<br><br>
                        When the village was first opened to the public at bank holidays, it was vital that you kept to the marked paths as it was not unusual for a wandering cow or sheep to get killed by a shell buried since the war.<br><br>
                        My father would take us there to visit the church especially, and to wander round the village where he would tell us who lived where and tales about the villagers.<br><br>

                        We visited this fascinating hidden place at the weekend for the first time - many thanks to everyone who helps keep it a place for people to come and look at and learn about.<br><br>
                        Our visit was marred by a group of people who thought it was ok to climb on the buildings and make a lot of noise in doing so - the parents weren't keeping the children under control but were themselves climbing on the old walls!<br><br>
                        Thankfully the outstanding views as one drives to and from the village made up for that and we loved the opportunity to go to Tyneham.

                        I am Jason Edmunds / Warr is my mums maiden name and we are a Tynham family. I went to Tynham for the first time in my life in 2017 and had no idea of our history. I am a New Zealander and live in Waiheke Island and would love to know where our family went to ? My mum now lives in Swanage Dorset England with her sister and there's Warr's in Australia so it would be great if anyone has any information,…..

                        I have recently visited the beautiful village of Tyneham (summer 2020). Because of COVID restrictions we were not able to go inside the church, the schoolhouse or any of the farm buildings. Even with these restrictions the essence of this quaint little village could not stop itself finding its way into my heart. It will stay there forever.<br><br>
                        We will go back to Tyneham once this pandemic has passed so we can walk into the church, school and outbuildings.<br><br>
                        Why can't the army give this beautiful village back the peace and tranquility it enjoyed before they arrived. It makes me weep to think of the poor residents that were given promises to return but promises, that were never honoured.<br><br>
                        It's an absolute disgrace. The sadness in that village will live with me forever.

                        Very much enjoyed our visit today, the people who had to leave their homes made a great sacrifice. I'd love to know what the tall spike flowers growing outside the bull house are called, I don't recall ever seeing flowers like them elsewhere
