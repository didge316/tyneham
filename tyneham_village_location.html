                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        Access to <a href="index.html"><strong>Tyneham</strong></a> Village is facilitated by a network of roads that wind through the tranquil countryside of Dorset, offering visitors the opportunity to revel in the beauty of the region as they approach the village.

                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        As a testament to its location within an area of natural significance, Tyneham Village benefits from its close proximity to the Jurassic Coast, a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/"><strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong></a> famous for its geological significance and stunning rock formations. This location imbues the village with a unique character that draws both history enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        Tyneham Village is no longer inhabited, so don't expect lots of signposts! Directions to Tyneham village are quite straight forward, though. Bear in mind that Tyneham does not have a postcode, so searching for a 'Tyneham postcode' won't get you to the village!
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        You can, however, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fCXWMSiNWEZkZy6u6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click on this link</a> for a Google Maps location that you can use for your SatNav. Because of Tyneham's location, the mobile phone coverage is quite limited! If you are planning on using satellite navigation, then it's probably a good idea to download the data as an offline map. It's also a good idea to check the <a href="opening_times.html"><strong>Tyneham village opening times</strong></a> to make sure the village is actually open. Also, note that the only access to <a href="worbarrow-bay.html"><strong>Worbarrow Bay</strong></a> is through main gate to Tyneham valley.
