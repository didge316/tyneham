                                        I recently saw an episode of country tracks which was aired on BBC 1 on 22/08/2010 which was episode 47. It was a piece about tyneham village and featured Doug Churchill talking about having to leave his old house during the war. When the piece started on the programme presented by Jodie Kidd there was a piece of very enchanting music that was so beautiful that I can't get it out of my head and I can't find any information of what the music was. Can anyone help me to try and track it down. Thanks
