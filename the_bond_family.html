          <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-2">The Arrival of the Bond Family</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The Bond family's connection with Tyneham stretches back over three centuries, shaping both the great house and the village around it. Their story is one of ownership, tradition, and deep ties to the Dorset countryside.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            It all began in 1683 when Nathaniel Bond purchased Tyneham House and the surrounding estates, including Creech Grange. From that moment, the Bonds became the dominant family in the area, their lives intertwined with the village for generations to come.

          <div class="float-end ms-4 mb-4">
            <img class="img-fluid rounded shadow" 
                 src="/assets/john-bond.jpg"

          </div>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            One of the darker chapters in the family's early history involves Lady Alice Lisle, granddaughter of Edith Bond. In 1685, following the Battle of Sedgemoor, Lady Alice was convicted of sheltering a fugitive from the Monmouth Rebellion. She was originally sentenced to be burned at the stake, but public outrage led to the sentence being changed to beheading. This dramatic event added a layer of notoriety to the Bond name in those turbulent times.

          <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Custodians of Tyneham</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Over the next century, ownership passed down through the family: from Nathaniel to John, then Dennis, and finally Reverend William Bond. During their stewardship, the Bonds left lasting marks on the village - most notably building the south transept of St Mary's Church as a private family chapel.

          <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Commitment to Education</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            In the mid-19th century, Nathaniel Bond (a later member of the family) demonstrated the Bonds' ongoing care for the community by funding the construction of <a href="https://tynehamvillage.org/tyneham-school/">Tyneham School</a> in the 1850s - a clear sign of their sense of responsibility toward the villagers.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Shifting Tides in the 20th Century</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The early 20th century saw the estate pass to Algernon Bond in 1911, and then to his nephew Ralph Bond in 1935. Ralph became the last Bond to own Tyneham House before the village's forced evacuation in 1943. The broken government promise that residents could return after the war deeply affected him - it's said he never fully recovered from losing his family home.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Lilian Bond - Perhaps the Most Famous Member of the Family</h3>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Ralph's sister Lilian Bond stands out as one of the most remarkable figures in the family's history. Growing up at Tyneham House with views over Worbarrow Bay, she developed a fierce independence that defined her life.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            During World War II, with many men away fighting, Lilian took on roles traditionally held by men - managing land and livestock with skill and determination. She became a pillar of support for the remaining villagers, always ready with practical help or a sympathetic ear.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Her most lasting contribution came in 1956 with the publication of her book "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0946159181/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0946159181&linkCode=as2&tag=dorsetdvdscom-21&linkId=be148fcbe0c78d92bb403bcb2f9f2e02">Tyneham: A Lost Heritage</a>". Through fourteen heartfelt chapters, Lilian preserved the memories, stories, and daily life of the village that was taken from its residents - ensuring Tyneham's spirit would live on long after the houses fell silent.

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            The Bond family's centuries-long connection with Tyneham left an indelible mark on both the landscape and the community's memory. From church additions to school buildings, from dramatic historical events to quiet acts of care - their influence shaped the village we remember today.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
            Though the family no longer owns Tyneham House, their name remains synonymous with the village's story - a reminder of how deeply one family can become woven into the fabric of a place and its people.

                        During the early sixties i was stationed in Wuppertal Germany with the 3rd Greenjackets, The Rifle Brigade. During that time i was a driver/operator to a Major Mark Bond who told me he had for a time served with the Parachute Regiment in North Africa. At that time i was trying to get accepted for a course with P coy in Aldershot.<br><br>
                        When we returned to the UK for a posting to Cyprus I was accepted for P Coy and I believe it was through some input from Maj. Bond that I was accepted. I passed P Coy and was posted to 1 Para. I always remember in winter he wore his grandfathers Rifle Green Greatcoat with black buttons.<br><br>
                        He was a good officer, well liked, though he could be cold and very private at times, I have nothing but good memories of him. I was a bit of a wild card and would joke that he only kept me on because I amused him.<br><br>
                        Was he a member of the family that owned Tyneham and tried to get it back? I have been living in NZ since 1971 but still consider myself an Englishman and still have a British passport. I have lost touch with most of my old comrades from the Rifles but still keep in touch with the Paras.<br><br>

                                Yes, Major (later Major-General) was the Mark Bond whose parents had to leave Tyneham. He was a great man, describing himself as “busy in public life, but quiet in private life”, to describe his voluntary work in Dorset after his retirement from the Army. He was my much-loved uncle, and died in 2017.

                                I served with R Company 3 RGJ in the mid 70s. My wife and I also dearly love Tyneham. We recently were lucky enough to purchase Lillian Bond's 1956 book Tyneham and I'm reading a chapter or two out loud to my wife over the Christmas 2020 holidays. What an incredible book it is. It brings Tyneham House to life for us. We, as I am sure many before us have, fallen in love with Tyneham and Warbarrow Bay. Such a very very special place. ✊
