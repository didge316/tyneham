            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
              St Mary's Church may be small compared to many Dorset churches, but it served the villagers of Tyneham
              perfectly for centuries. Built mainly from local limestone rubble, parts of the building date back to the
              13th century.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
              In the mid-19th century, Reverend William Bond rebuilt the south transept as a private chapel for the Bond
              family of Tyneham House. Outside in the graveyard, you can still find several memorials to the Bonds who
              played such a big part in village life.

              After the military requisitioned Tyneham in 1943, the church fell into neglect. Many of its fittings were
              removed and rehoused elsewhere - the bells and organ went to Steeple church, and the fine Jacobean pulpit
              was moved to Lulworth Camp.

            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 pt-2">
              The church has since been carefully restored and now serves two important roles. First, it acts as a small
              museum telling the story of Tyneham - filled with displays, old photographs, documents, timelines and
              artefacts that bring the village's history vividly to life.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
              Second, it stands as a quiet memorial to the lost community. The names of former villagers are inscribed
              around the walls, and a restored Bible bears their memory. It's a moving reminder of the peaceful life
              that was taken away overnight.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
              Perhaps the most famous artefact is the handwritten note pinned to the church door by the last villagers
              to leave in December 1943:

                    lived for generations to help win the war to keep men free. We shall return one day and thank you

              St Mary's is one of the most atmospheric spots in Tyneham - well worth spending time in when the village
              is open. Even on busy days, the church offers a peaceful place to reflect on the story of this remarkable
              lost community.

                    Been to Tyneham today - 1st April 2013 - sad that there is no way of visiting the great house - even
                    as a shell. The farmhouse was also a pile of rubble - however the very fact you can visit is
                    fascinating - to see what time can do when left to its own.

                    Seven of our family visited Tyneham yesterday March 19th. Good to see the church is being preserved
                    so well by a local charity.<br><br>
                    It is sad that Tyneham House was so badly treated by the MOD and that even the ruins are not
                    accessible.<br><br>
                    It is hard to imagine that 30,000 US troops were absorbed in this area in 1943/1944 - training for
                    D-Day.<br><br>
                    I had hoped for a memorial for the almost 1,000 US soldiers and seaman that lost their lives in the
                    tragic Exercise Tiger, training for the Utah beach landing - 5 times the number killed at Utah
                    beach! I believe I will have to visit Slapton Sands for the only UK Memorial of this tragic event in
                    WWII
